The Quest: of El Caballero

Our game is an action adventure where the main character is solving difficult puzzles

The object of our game is to solve puzzles the were created by the puzzle creating poacher.

After the death of his burro, Chichorito in a freak accident by the puzzle creating poacher, El Caballero went through a troubled period of depression, but discovered the joys of solving puzzles for justice. After honing his puzzle solving skills he went out on a quest to seek vengence against the puzzle creating poacher, and his quest is guided by La Cucaracha.

Our game will contain sprite sheets for main characters and villians, background images, obstacles, and his trusty sombrero.
